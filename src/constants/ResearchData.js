        The Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH) has initiated the
        <b> Short Term Studentship (STSH) Program</b> in order to promote interest and
        aptitude for research among the medical undergraduates. Our institute
        has its own Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) which reviews the
        research proposals and gives suggestions to the investigators to make
        their research ethical before approving them. Research protocols of two
        students Kankona Das and Debayan Khan respectively were approved by the
        CCRH in the year 2021. Altogether IEC has approved nine research
        protocols in the year 2022 which have been submitted to CCRH.
        <br />
        <br />
       In 2022, the Council received  <b>1092 proposals</b> under the STSH 2022 program  
        from students of various colleges. After evaluation, 282 have been
        shortlisted under STSH 2022 for undertaking research work and submission
        of the final report. From our college <b> 8 students are shortlisted </b> under
