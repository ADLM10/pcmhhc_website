        The Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH) has initiated the
        Short Term Studentship (STSH) Program in order to promote interest and
        aptitude for research among the medical undergraduates. Our institute
        has its own Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) which reviews the
        research proposals and gives suggestions to the investigators to make
        their research ethical before approving them. Research protocols of two
        students Kankona Das and Debayan Khan respectively were approved by the
        CCRH in the year 2021. Altogether IEC has approved nine research
        protocols in the year 2022 which have been submitted to CCRH.
