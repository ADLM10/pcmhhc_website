        Nelson Mandela rightly said, “Education is the most important weapon to change the world.” Education plays an important role in the development of an individual and making him a knowledgeable citizen. It is the education that makes an individual self-reliant, helps to suppress the social evils and contribute towards the development of the society and nation as a whole.<br/>
        <br/>
        Being the Principal of one of the oldest, elegant and reputed homoeopathy Institutions in West Bengal under WBUHS, I take pride in the fact that our students obtain the highest quality of education and enjoy a colorful cozy future. I also take pride in our dedicated altruistic non-teaching staff and distinguished teaching faculty who offer their best at meager remuneration. Our excellence is not just confined to the classroom; we are also notably active in conducting conferences, workshops, seminars, guests' lectures and other co-curricular activities. Students are imparted an all round education so that they become multi-dimensional.  Today education helps in unraveling the mystery of nature. It enables us to understand and improve the working of our society. It creates conditions for a better life, brings out the capabilities to fight injustice happening in society. So we pay utmost importance to teaching quality and practical training. Our academic record has been outstanding since the inception of the institution. Besides bagging top position in the University's Annual Examination, our institution has a commendable record of very high pass percentage every year.<br/>
        <br/>
        I am overwhelmed to have moral value-based learning from such a prestigious institution and again received the charge as a Principal of that same Reverend Institution.<br/>
        <br/>
        I hope, our College website will give a right impression of our institution and I extend my wholehearted wish and thanks to all the users of our Institution's website.
